Purpose of the software
=======================

Goal is to enable user to run solar sytem-scale(ish) gravitational simulations for bodies using classical physics, relativistic effects will not be accounted for. 

Planned functionality
=====================

Following might be subject to change depending on any new ideas during making, but initially:
* User is able to edit simulation parameters; gravitational constant, timestep and total simulation time, either by UI, or file.
* User is able to add new bodies to the simulation and edit their parameters and initial phase-space locations, either by UI, or by same prepared file as in last point. 
* User is able to view an animation of the simulation, either as it is running or after computation, or both, exact cheices to be decided upon how badly animation would impact computation speed.
* Simulation timesteps will be saved during the run, but can be saved to a file afterwards.

Possible additions to functionality
===================================

* Possibly might use a local database to save simulations, althought it might not be best suited for it.
